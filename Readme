A POST operation will be made with the following data 
- CustomerID 
- Subtotal 

The API will access a list of (CustomerID, SurchargePercentage) pairs that are stored in a mock 
repository and then return when successful the following 
- CustomerId 
- Subtotal 
- Surcharge Amount 
- Total 
The endpoint is called CalculateTotal and receives the data via a POST 

Calculation Examples 
- Given a subtotal of 100 and a surcharge of 5% return a total of 105 
- Given a subtotal of 200 and a surcharge of 4% return a total of 208 
- Given a subtotal of X and a surcharge of Y% return a total of X + (X * Y/100) 

Stored Data 
The following values are stored in a repository the API owns. This does not need to persist to a 
database but represent a form of storage for this exercise. 

Customer ID | Surcharge Percentage 
  1 | 5 
  2 | 10 
  3 | 7 
  4 | 4.25
